    ##Screening services can vary dramatically, but it's our approach that sets us apart.

    We're committed to your long-term success, a trusted partner that’s in it for the long haul. 

    We help companies like yours elevate your hiring success. Bad hiring decisions cost time and money, undermine performance, destroy culture and sidetrack careers. To combat this, we've built a service that's designed to provide deeper insight into the candidates you recruit, interview, consider and hire. 

    As a family-owned business we may no longer be small, but it will never be our way to act big. We’ve built an amazing team with amazing people and by practicing what we sell. Our promise is to provide the services you need to play that high-stakes hiring game to win. 

    ScreeningOne is one of the fastest growing background screening companies – it has been recognized on the 2010 and 2011 Inc 5000 List of the fastest growing private companies in America.  In addition, the company was featured on the 2010 and 2011 Tampa Bay Business Journals Fast50 List, which celebrates the fastest growing companies in the Tampa area.

    I'm excited to share with you our stable of services that we'll tailor to you.
