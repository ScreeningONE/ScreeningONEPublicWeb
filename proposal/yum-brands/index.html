  Screening services can vary dramatically, but it's
  our approach that sets us apart.
</div>

<p>
  We're committed to your long-term success, a trusted
  partner that’s in it for the long haul. 
</p>

<p>
  We help companies like yours elevate your hiring
  success. Bad hiring decisions cost time and money,
  undermine performance, destroy culture and sidetrack
  careers. To combat this, we've built a service
  that's designed to provide deeper insight into the
  candidates you recruit, interview, consider and hire. 
</p>

<p>
  As a family-owned business we may no longer be small,
  but it will never be our way to act big. We’ve built
  an amazing team with amazing people and by practicing
  what we sell. Our promise is to provide the services
  you need to play that high-stakes hiring game to win. 
</p>

<p>
  ScreeningOne is one of the fastest growing background
  screening companies – it has been recognized on the
  2010 and 2011 Inc 5000 List of the fastest growing
  private companies in America.  In addition, the
  company was featured on the 2010 and 2011 Tampa Bay
  Business Journals Fast50 List, which celebrates the
  fastest growing companies in the Tampa area.
</p>

<p>
  I'm excited to share with you our stable of services
  that we'll tailor to you.
